Title:

MAJOR UPDATE! Crafting Guide—Ultimate step-by-step guide to make anything

Body:

Have you ever wanted to figure out how much of what materials you need to craft something? Ever notice that certain
recipes are pretty easy... until you account for all the machines you need? Ever wonder how much stuff you'll need to
make a [Quarry](http://crafting-guide.com/item/quarry) or an entire
[QuantumSuit](http://crafting-guide.com/quantumsuit_bodyarmor)?

Crafting Guide will help. Choose what you want to make and how many of each, and it will automatically figure out:

* How many of what resources do you need?
* What tools / machines do you need?
* How many of what resource do you need for the tools?
* What items do you need to craft in what order?

I've just launched a brand-new version with support for vanilla, Buildcraft, and IndustrialCraft2 (classic) recipes.
It's all open-source, so anyone can help expand it to cover missing recipes, other mods, or add new features. Check out
the [GitHub project](https://github.com/andrewminer/crafting-guide) if you'd like to get involved!

If you've seen it before, go look again. There's a whole new site now, which supports a lot more than the old one did:

* All items have matching icons
* All recipes show the proper layout on the crafting grid
* You now get step-by-step instructions
* You can now make many different items at once (e.g., a whole NanoSuit)

A few more updates to report!  First, now your preferences for which mods are active and whether tools are included
will be remembered between visits. Second, I've finished adding support for Thermal Expansion 4.  The crafting algorithm
doesn't yet taken into account the ore-doubling/tripling machinery, but all the recipes for the entire mod are present
and functional.  I'll work on using the machines in a future update.  Next up: IC2 Experimental!

I've just finished adding support for the latest version of Industrial Craft (2.2.663 on the experimental branch).  I've
also updated the site to let you select the version you're using.

I just pushed up a big new feature!  Now, each Mod has a dedicated page of its own which lists all the items available
in that mod.  Clicking on an item will take you to the crafting guide for that item. It's super fast to switch back and
forth to explore the items in any given mod.  This is the first of many steps for the new mod pages, so keep an eye out
for more to come!

I've been working on a project to make it easier to deal with complex recipes, and I recently finished adding all the
core Minecraft recipes. The gist of the site is that you tell it what item(s) you want to make, and it will figure out
all the raw ingredients you need along with step-by-step instructions for any number of whatever items you like. For
example, [http://crafting-guide.com/crafting/16.potion_of_fire_resistance_8_00:16.potion_of_healing_ii here's how you
make] 16 potions of healing II and fire resistance (with extended duration).

The maintainers of many of the mods I've added (e.g., BuildCraft / Applied Energistics) have found it useful to include
links to Crafting Guide in their official documentation, and I was hoping you would think it a good idea to add links
from this wiki to CraftingGuide as well.  I'd be happy to do the work of adding the links myself, but I'd like to make
sure there are no objections first!

Thanks!
