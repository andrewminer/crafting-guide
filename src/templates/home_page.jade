                        Crafting Guide is the ultimate resource for Minecraft. Whether you're punching trees or building
                        reactors, you'll find Crafting Guide indispensable.

                        This release delivers the second major expansion of Crafting Guide! Here's the list of what's
                        new:
                    ul
                        li New home page!
                        li Moved the crafting planner (the old home page) to its own <a href="/craft">Craft</a> page
                        li Moved mod pack management to the new <a href="/configure">Configure</a> page
                        li Added a <a href="/browse">Browse</a> page where you can peruse the list of supported mods

                    p.
                        This release adds a new section to the item pages called "Used as Tool to Make". The new section
                        shows all the other items which can be made by that tool. For example, the IC2 Macerator shows
                        a bunch of things like Iron Dust, Gold Dust, etc.

                        This release changes the crafting page to let you modify the quantity of items in the "Items You
                        Want" and "Items You Have" section.  Let's say you want to make <a
                        href="/craft/64.potion_of_healing">64 Potions of Healing</a>. You add "Potion of Healing" just
                        as as you always did, but now you can click on the quantity to change it to whatever you want.
                    p.
                        At the same time, I've changed the quantity field to allow up to 9999 of any item. Have fun with
                        those huge builds!

                        Woo hoo! Or, should I say: Choo choo! I just added support for RailCraft! I also pushed up lots
                        of performance improvements (55% faster at computing crafting plans)! Hopefully, you won't
                        really notice anything except that entering new items and computing really complicated crafting
                        plans don't take so long.

                    p.
                        I just made some major updates to the crafting algorithm. Without getting into details, I'll say
                        that there are a few things you should notice:
                    ol
                        li it will favor recipes which produce more of an item versus those which produce fewer (e.g.,
                            | IC2 plates get made with the Block Cutter instead of the Forge Hammer)
                        li metal ingots will frequently (but not always) get crafted using 2x recipes instead of
                            | smelting ore directly in a furnace
                        li recipes for vanilla items added by mods are now available (e.g., smelting Iron Dust into Iron
                            | ingots)

                h3 2015-02-10
                .entry
                    p.
                        I just pushed up some fixes to avoid confusing various items of the same name from different
                        mods.  The best example of this are the two Wrenches from Buildcraft and IC2, but there are a
                        bunch of others.

                h3 2015-02-09

                    p.
                        This release fixes a number of small issues and improves performance in a number of places. Most
                        especially, all links within the site have been changed to update the page in place without the
                        need to re-download anything.  This should make browsing between item pages <i>much</i> faster.

                h3 2015-02-08
                .entry
                    p.
                        This is the singlest largest expansion of the website yet! Each item from each mod now has its
                        own page! This will expand in the future, but for now this shows all the recipes for the item as
                        well as all the closely related items and the others items that can be made using the item.
                    p.
                        This also changes things so that links to Crafting Guide from other sites will first go to the
                        item's page (instead of to the crafting plan).  Not to worry though... there's still a direct
                        link from each item to the full crafting plan for that item.

                h3 2015-02-02

                    p.
                        Crafting Guide now has support for EnderIO! I tend to add new mods in order of those with the
                        most votes, so remember to suggest your favorites!
