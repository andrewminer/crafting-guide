                Crafting Guide gives step-by-step instructions for making anything in Minecraft or its many mods. Just
                say what you'd like to make, what you already have, it will do the rest, giving you a list of raw
                materials and instructions of which items to make in the proper order. You can even ask it to include
                the materials and instructions for all the tools you'll need along the way!
