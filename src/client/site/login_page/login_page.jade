                Use your GitHub credentials to login and make changes on Crafting Guide. No GitHub account? Don't
                worry, you can get one for free. <a class="read-more" href="#">read more...</a>

                    p.
                        All changes you make on the site get submitted directly to our GitHub repo, and then published
                        through the same automated deployment process as changes made by anyone else. That way, anyone
                        can contribute easily: whether programmer or player.
                    p.
                        To log in, we redirect you to GitHub's site.  Once you're signed in over there, they'll send you
                        back here. We never see your credentials, and only get the minimum set of permissions necessary
                        to submit changes to the Crafting Guide repo on your behalf.
                    p.
                        GitHub offers free accounts, so even if you don't already have one, you've got nothing to lose!
