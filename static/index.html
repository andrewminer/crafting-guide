</a></p></div></div></div><div class="section"><h2><a>What's new?</a></h2><div class="panel"><h3><a>2015-04-11</a></h3><div class="entry"><p><a>I've just finished adding </a><a href="/browse/simply_jetpacks">Simply Jetpacks</a> by Tonius.  It
seems like a simple mod on the surface, but what with all the upgrades and technology tiers, it
takes an amazing <a href="/craft/flux_infused_jetplate">87 steps</a> to make the highest-tier
jetpack!</p><p>I've also added <a href="/browse/solar_flux">Solar Flux</a> by Nauktis. Again, another
deceptively simple mod, but the <a href="/browse/solar_flux/solar_panel_vi/">most powerful solar
panel</a> kicks out an impressive 4096 RF/t! I just hope your mine has been productive... among
other things, you'll need 45 Diamonds, 110 Gold Ore, 1568 Copper Ore, and 6023 Iron Ore!
</p></div><h3>2015-04-08</h3><div class="entry"><p>I've been working on improving the crafting plan a bit. You're now able to represent recipes
which require a stack of inputs (e.g., making <a href="/browse/enderio/fused_quartz/">Fused
Quartz</a> from EnderIO). This allows for a number of improvements, especially in how fluids are
handled. Check out the crafting plan for a
<a href="/craft/cryo_stabilized_fluxduct">Cryo-Stabilized Fluxduct</a>, for example.</p><p>I've also added support for MachineMuse's <a href="/browse/modular_powersuits">Modular
Powersuits</a>!  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get any recipe sets working other than the
vanilla set, but if anyone has any other working recipes files, I'd be happy to add them!
</p></div><h3>2015-04-06</h3><div class="entry"><p>I've just added a site-wide search feature right next to the other navigation controls. Just
click it and start typing to find any item in your active mod pack. Head over to the
<a href="/configure">configure</a> page to adjust what mods are in your pack.</p><p>The really big news, though, is that <a href="http://github.com/TiuTalk">Thiago Belem</a>'s real
project is complete: <a href="/browse/extra_utilities">Extra Utilites</a>! One of the most
highly requested mods, this is a fantastic addition to the growing list of mods supported by
Crafting Guide. A huge "Thank You!" to Thiago for his contributions!
</p></div><h3>2015-04-04</h3><div class="entry"><p>Thanks to <a href="http://github.com/TiuTalk">Thiago Belem</a>, Crafting Guide now has support
for <a href="/browse/ender_storage">Ender Storage</a>!  While it's only a few items, it's a very
handy mod well worth having in your mod pack!  Thanks, Thiago!
</p></div><h3>2015-04-03</h3><div class="entry"><p>You've asked for it, and now it's finally here... <a href="/browse/mekanism">Mekanism</a>
support is now available! There is one important caveat... I can't figure out the exact
quantities of all the various liquid-based recipes, so the numbers have been completely omitted
for that part and probably are a bit incorrect. If you have any further information about those
recipes, please let me know!
</p></div><h3>2015-04-02</h3><div class="entry"><p>BuildCraft just got an upgrade to the latest version, 6.4.6.  This is a much bigger upgrade than
it may seem because this actually adds a lot of missing items and recipes all the way back to
BuildCraft 4.x. So, now you can enjoy crafting plans which include the new integration table,
lenses, filters, and... Robots!
</p></div><h3>2015-03-24</h3><div class="entry"><p>I've just added support for ProfMobius' excellent JABBA (Just Another Better Barrel Attempt).
Thanks for the anonymous suggestion via the <a href="/configure">Configure</a> page!  If
Crafting Guide is missing a mod you use, feel free to head over there to suggest it.</p><p>I've also added support for <a href="/browse/iron_chests">Iron Chests</a>, and with them, I've
taken advantage of some of the new features of the site to add descriptions for each item.
</p></div><h3>2015-03-21</h3><div class="entry"><p>I spent some time today cleaning up the various animations throughout the site, and working on
page rendering performance. Things should generally feel a lot smoother now.
</p></div><h3>2015-03-20</h3><div class="entry"><p>Recently, I've been working on allowing mod authors to add more detail to the item pages here on
Crafting Guide. To that end, there are a couple of new features to announce. First, item detail
pages can now show text and pictures to describe the item (check out the <a href="/browse/buildcraft/assembly_table">Assembly Table</a> for an example).  Second, mods can
now include tutorial pages containing similar text and pictures to describe tricky concepts,
complex builds, or anything else their mod has to offer (see <a href="/browse/buildcraft/tutorials/gates_wires_and_chips">Gates, Wires, and Chips</a> for an
example). Finally, both item pages and tutorial pages can display a list of YouTube videos. Only
a few pages in the Buildcraft section have been updated so far, but keep an eye out for
more to come!</p><p>And... the second piece of news is that Crafting Guide now supports <a href="/browse/thermal_dynamics">Thermal Dynamics</a>! This mod is an off-shoot from <a href="/browse/thermal_expansion">Thermal Expansion</a> which contains all the ducts (item, fluid
and redstone flux) you're used to from TE3 plus some extras both for higher capacity throughput
and combining item ducts with redstone flux ducts.
</p></div><h3>2015-03-13</h3><div class="entry"><p>Happy Friday! For the weekend, you get <a href="/browse/big_reactors/">Big Reactors!</a> Enjoy!
</p></div><h3>2015-03-12</h3><div class="entry"><p>Thanks to the extraordinary generosity and effort of <a href="https://github.com/sheldongriffin">Sheldon Griffin</a>, Crafting Guide now supports
Forestry! Forestry is <i>not</i> a small mod, but he put in a huge effort, and it looks great.
If you'd like to help out too, head over to the <a href="https://github.com/andrewminer/crafting-guide/wiki/Adding-support-for-a-new-Mod">GitHub
Wiki</a> for full instructions: no programming required!</p><p>Also in the works is another significant expansion to the item pages. I've got the coding part
finished (you can peek at the final result <a href="/browse/buildcraft/advanced_crafting_table/">here</a>), and
now there's a lot of entering data left to be done... any volunteers?
</p></div><h3>2015-03-09</h3><div class="entry"><p>It may seem like not much has been happening lately, but that's because all the changes have
been behind the scenes, and focused on making Google happier with the site.  This will make the
site show up better is search results, and will make it load a bit faster.</p><p>As a result of this work, the site also now qualifies for AdSense. I absolutely don't want to
choke the site with ads as other big sites do, but it will be nice to pay the bills!</p></div></div></div></div></div>

          <p>
            Crafting Guide gives step-by-step tutorials for making anything in Minecraft or its many mods. Just say what
            you'd like to make, what you already have, it will do the rest, giving you a list of raw materials you need
            to collect and step-by-step instructions of how much to make of which items in the proper order. You can
            even ask it to include the materials and instructions for all the tools you'll need along the way!
