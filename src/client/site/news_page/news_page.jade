                    Since my last update, I've been hard at work on rebuilding the guts of the core feature of the
                    website: the crafting algorithm.  I'm happy to announce that as of yesterday evening, it's finally
                    complete!  The new algorithm is <i>blazing</i> fast!  Like... crafting plans which used to take so
                    long that they never completed will finish in well under a second.  Super fast.
                p.
                    An added benefit is that the algorithm change also required a change to the way mod data is stored.
                    Without getting into too much detail, the old way went back to the very earliest version of the site
                    which assumed people would be adding files for their own recipe lists, and therefore had to look up
                    each item and each recipe each time it was needed because it could never be sure what something like
                    "Copper Ingot" referred to until running the algorithm. Very, very slow.
                p.  Of course, it's been ages since that was actually a feature on the site. So, the new way sends all
                    the data for an entire modpack up all at once, and in a format where everything is directly
                    connected to everything else. Much, much faster!

                    After a few reqeusts to streamline how you configure your modpack, I've updated the
                    <a href="/browse">Browse</a> page so that you can toggle on &amp; off which mods you're using all
                    from that one page.  That should make it a lot easier to get things set up just as you like them!

                    Boy, this is a lot faster!  I've updated <a href="/browse/thermal_expansion/">Thermal Expansion</a>,
                    <a href="/browse/thermal_foundation/">Thermal Foundation</a>, and <a
                    href="/browse/thermal_dynamics/">Thermal Dynamics</a> to the latest version, and I've added <a
                    href="/browse/redstone_arsenal/">Redstone Arsenal</a> and <a href="/browse/solar_expansion/">Solar
                    Expansion</a> just in the last couple of days!  My plan for now is to get all the currently
                    supported mods refreshed using the new exporter mod, and then move on to adding new ones.

                    As successful as things were with the MineTweaker dump file, there were just too many things for it
                    to be remotely sufficient for doing most of the more complex mods out there (e.g., BuildCraft,
                    ThermalExpansion, and the like).  So, inspired by having successfully tinkered around with the
                    MineTweaker code, I've actually started my own <a
                    href="https://github.com/andrewminer/crafting-guide-exporter">Crafting Guide Exporter</a> mod.  It's
                    been growing rapidly, and so far I've managed a refresh of all the <a
                    href="/browse/minecraft/">Minecraft 1.7.10 items along with refreshing my <a
                    href="/browse/buildcraft/">BuildCraft</a> data to the latest version (7.1.17).
                p.
                    Even more than with my prior efforts to automate data collection, I'm thrilled with how easy this
                    makes it to gather a huge amount of data very rapidly.  I'm still learning my way around modding, so
                    there are definitely still bumps, but with kind help from other modders out there, I'm learing my
                    way!

                    I've been taking a break from the site for a while now to work on a couple of other projects.
                    However, I recently found out that <a href="minetweaker3.powerofbytes.com">MineTweaker</a> has a few
                    commands which can dump various kind of data from the game, including <i>RECIPES</i>.  This is a
                    really big deal since, up until now, entering recipes has always been a laborious, manual process.
                    However, I've just finished the first version of a script which can transform MineTweaker's output
                    into a Crafting Guide data file.
                p.
                    As a test-drive, I picked a mod near the top of the list, <a
                    href="https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/draconic-evolution">Draconic Evolution</a>, and I
                    got a fully functional data file build in a tiny fraction of the time it would have taken the manual
                    way.  Even better, if a new version comes out, I can easily re-run the script to update it again.
                p.
                    If you've been thinking you'd like to help out with Crafting Guide, but have found the process too
                    laborious, you might want to give it another look!

                    Today I added the ability for you to vote on which mods you'd like to see added to the site next!
                    Just got to the <a href="/browse">browse page</a>, and scroll all the way to the bottom.  After
                    logging in, you can cast up to 3 votes for mods you'd like to see added to the site.  And, if your
                    favorites aren't on the list, you can fill out the form at the very bottom to suggest them.
                p.
                    While you can't really see it, I've also set up some important stuff behind the scenes which will
                    allow me to add a lot of cool new features to the site which weren't possible before.  The voting
                    feature is actually just a small test of all the new stuff you can't actually see, so expect to see
                    some really cool stuff coming up next!

                    Big news... no, huge news... no, tiny news!  Crafting Guide is now fully functional on any size
                    screen from a 30" desktop monitor all the way down to a 4" phone.  Just grab your favorite mobile
                    device and give it a try!

                    I've been knocking off a few more feature requests over the weekend.  First, I've made the entire
                    site respond to being on a smaller screen (tablet-sized for now, phone-sized will be next).
                    Hopefully, it should just feel pretty natural on whatever screen size, and you won't notice any big
                    differences from one to the other.
                p.
                    The second small change is that whenever you're looking at a recipe which calls for a <i>lot</i> of
                    some item, you can hover over the quantity to see what it would be in stacks + the remainder. For
                    example, 127 translates to: 1x64+63.  That should make it easier to think about large builds.

                    I've spent some time working on the crafting page today, and I think you'll find it a lot easier to
                    adjust your plans now.  The big difference is that the site no longer automatically calculate.
                    Instead, you have to deliberately press a button when you're ready for a new plan.  This allows you
                    to check out an existing plan, mark certain steps complete, adjust your inventory, and only when
                    you're ready, click the button for a new plan.  Not a huge change, but I think you'll find yourself
                    adjusting a not-quite-right plan a lot more often now!

                p.
                    The most highly-requested mod currently on my list is <a href="/browse/tinkers_construct">Tinker's
                    Construct</a>, and I'm pleased to announce that it is now available on Crafting Guide!  In case you
                    aren't familiar with it, it adds the ability to create tools by crafting together individual parts
                    made from different materials, and adds a complex smelting mechanic which allows you to create a
                    variety of useful metal alloys.  This smelting has the side-effect of producing two ingots for every
                    block of ore as well, so you can very rapidly get to ore-doubling without having to have already got
                    a complex power system up and running.
                p.
                    There is <i>one</i> thing missing.  I didn't include any recipes for the actual tools themselves.
                    The problem, of course, is that you can mix and match parts made from any of the supported
                    materials, and that leads to thousands upon thousands of possible tools: way more than would ever be
                    practical to include in Crafting Guide in the obvious way other items are included.
                p.
                    The plan, then, is to create a feature just for Tinker's Construct which allows you to select a tool
                    to create, and then pick and choose the material types for each part.  You'll then be able to make a
                    crafting plan for those parts.  If that sounds like something you'd use, head over to <a
                    href="https://github.com/andrewminer/crafting-guide/issues/214">GitHub</a> and add your vote!

                    I've been working on adding a new mod, and I ran across a bug which has been in the system for a
                    while now, but which will cause serious problems with a lot of the recipes in the new mod. So, I put
                    the mod aside for a bit to fix it.
                p.
                    The bug was that when you are making something like an <a
                    href="/browse/forge_multipart/oak_wood_cover">Oak Wood Cover</a> the <a
                    href="/browse/forge_multipart/stone_saw">saw</a> wouldn't be part of the crafting plan. This isn't
                    such a big deal for most things, but for this new mod, it would have been a major problem.

                    In between adding new features to the website, I've taken a little break to add support for
                    <a href="/browse/projectred">ProjectRed</a>.  It takes up the mantle of the retired RedPower mod
                    and adds a lot of what that one used to provide: logic gates, cables, pneumatic tubes, and lots and
                    lots of new lights and lamps.

                    Today, I finally reveal the new Crafting Guide website!  While there are only minor changes to the
                    outward appearance, a <i>lot</i> has changed under the covers.  First, you should notice that the
                    general appearance is more consistently "Minecraft" in feel, and everything is quite a bit faster.
                    You should also notice that it works a little bit better on mobile devices (much more on that to
                    come).  Finally, you'll notice that things are organized a bit better than they have been in the
                    past.
                p.
                    If you've used the site before, one thing which has disappeared is the "configure" page.  Now, to
                    say which mods you're using, just go to the individual mod pages and select the version of that mod
                    you've got in your mod pack directly. Just as before, the rest of the website will adjust to use the
                    version you select (or to ignore that mod if you select "no" version).

                    added the data files for <a href="/browse/quantum_flux">Quantum Flux</a>. Quantum Flux provides
                    various items for moving RF power wirelessly and manipulating the flow of time.  It also

                    BuildCraft add-on called <a href="/browse/logistics_pipes">Logistics Pipes</a>.  This mod adds

                    on the site.  First up is <a href="/browse/agricraft">Agricraft</a>, contributed by
                    <a href="http://github.com/dragagon">dragagon</a>!  Agricraft takes the idea of crops from IC2
                    and pumps it up to a whole new level with a cross-breeding program that introduces a way to grow

                    noticed that the newest version (finally!) comes with default recipes.  So, I've updated
                    Crafting Guide to support both the newest vanilla recipes as well as those from Thermal
                    Expansion.  You can switch back and forth on the <a href="/configure">Configure</a> page.
