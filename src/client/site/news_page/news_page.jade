                    Big news... no, huge news... no, tiny news!  Crafting Guide is now fully functional on any size
                    screen from a 30" desktop monitor all the way down to a 4" phone.  Just grab your favorite mobile
                    device and give it a try!

                    I've been knocking off a few more feature requests over the weekend.  First, I've made the entire
                    site respond to being on a smaller screen (tablet-sized for now, phone-sized will be next).
                    Hopefully, it should just feel pretty natural on whatever screen size, and you won't notice any big
                    differences from one to the other.
                p.
                    The second small change is that whenever you're looking at a recipe which calls for a <i>lot</i> of
                    some item, you can hover over the quantity to see what it would be in stacks + the remainder. For
                    example, 127 translates to: 1x64+63.  That should make it easier to think about large builds.

                    I've spent some time working on the crafting page today, and I think you'll find it a lot easier to
                    adjust your plans now.  The big difference is that the site no longer automatically calculate.
                    Instead, you have to deliberately press a button when you're ready for a new plan.  This allows you
                    to check out an existing plan, mark certain steps complete, adjust your inventory, and only when
                    you're ready, click the button for a new plan.  Not a huge change, but I think you'll find yourself
                    adjusting a not-quite-right plan a lot more often now!

                    The most highly-requested mod currently on my list is <a href="/browse/tinkers_construct">Tinker's
                    Construct</a>, and I'm pleased to announce that it is now available on Crafting Guide!  In case you
                    aren't familiar with it, it adds the ability to create tools by crafting together individual parts
                    made from different materials, and adds a complex smelting mechanic which allows you to create a
                    variety of useful metal alloys.  This smelting has the side-effect of producing two ingots for every
                    block of ore as well, so you can very rapidly get to ore-doubling without having to have already got
                    a complex power system up and running.
                p.
                    There is <i>one</i> thing missing.  I didn't include any recipes for the actual tools themselves.
                    The problem, of course, is that you can mix and match parts made from any of the supported
                    materials, and that leads to thousands upon thousands of possible tools: way more than would ever be
                    practical to include in Crafting Guide in the obvious way other items are included.
                p.
                    The plan, then, is to create a feature just for Tinker's Construct which allows you to select a tool
                    to create, and then pick and choose the material types for each part.  You'll then be able to make a
                    crafting plan for those parts.  If that sounds like something you'd use, head over to <a
                    href="https://github.com/andrewminer/crafting-guide/issues/214">GitHub</a> and add your vote!

                    I've been working on adding a new mod, and I ran across a bug which has been in the system for a
                    while now, but which will cause serious problems with a lot of the recipes in the new mod. So, I put
                    the mod aside for a bit to fix it.
                p.
                    The bug was that when you are making something like an <a
                    href="/browse/forge_multipart/oak_wood_cover">Oak Wood Cover</a> the <a
                    href="/browse/forge_multipart/stone_saw">saw</a> wouldn't be part of the crafting plan. This isn't
                    such a big deal for most things, but for this new mod, it would have been a major problem.

                    In between adding new features to the website, I've taken a little break to add support for
                    <a href="/browse/projectred">ProjectRed</a>.  It takes up the mantle of the retired RedPower mod
                    and adds a lot of what that one used to provide: logic gates, cables, pneumatic tubes, and lots and
                    lots of new lights and lamps.

                    Today, I finally reveal the new Crafting Guide website!  While there are only minor changes to the
                    outward appearance, a <i>lot</i> has changed under the covers.  First, you should notice that the
                    general appearance is more consistently "Minecraft" in feel, and everything is quite a bit faster.
                    You should also notice that it works a little bit better on mobile devices (much more on that to
                    come).  Finally, you'll notice that things are organized a bit better than they have been in the
                    past.
                p.
                    If you've used the site before, one thing which has disappeared is the "configure" page.  Now, to
                    say which mods you're using, just go to the individual mod pages and select the version of that mod
                    you've got in your mod pack directly. Just as before, the rest of the website will adjust to use the
                    version you select (or to ignore that mod if you select "no" version).

                    The second contribution comes from <a href="http://github.com/kythorn">Jay Oliver</a> who has
                    added the data files for <a href="/browse/quantum_flux">Quantum Flux</a>. Quantum Flux provides
                    various items for moving RF power wirelessly and manipulating the flow of time.  It also
                    provides some pretty powerful powered armor.
                p.
                    The third contribution, from <a href="http://github.com/ThePsionic">ThePsionic</a>, is a
                    BuildCraft add-on called <a href="/browse/logistics_pipes">Logistics Pipes</a>.  This mod adds
                    a whole complex set of pipes which allow automated retrieval, crafting, sorting, and more.

                    I've gotten a few contributions of whole mods recently, and I'm catching up on getting them up
                    on the site.  First up is <a href="/browse/agricraft">Agricraft</a>, contributed by
                    <a href="http://github.com/dragagon">dragagon</a>!  Agricraft takes the idea of crops from IC2
                    and pumps it up to a whole new level with a cross-breeding program that introduces a way to grow
                    anything from native Minecraft flowers all the way up to diamonds!

                    I've been using <a href="/browse/modular_powersuits">Modular PowerSuits</a> myself lately, and I
                    noticed that the newest version (finally!) comes with default recipes.  So, I've updated
                    Crafting Guide to support both the newest vanilla recipes as well as those from Thermal
                    Expansion.  You can switch back and forth on the <a href="/configure">Configure</a> page.

                    Back before the winter holidays, the extremely patient <a href="https://github.com/tdallmann">
                    tdallmann</a> completed support for <a href="/browse/hydraulicraft/">Hydraulicraft</a>, and I'm
                    afraid I'm only now getting it up on the site!  It looks like a neat mod based all around the
                    science of hydraulics with a nicely stepped set of devices to be made at each level. Many thanks
                    to tddallmann for adding it to Crafting Guide!
                p.
                    I also received a submission for adding <a href="/browse/opencomputers">OpenComputers</a> from
                    <a href="https://github.com/yut23">yut23</a>.  Should be a big help to those aspiring Minecraft
                    programmers who want a bit more challege than is provided by <a href="/browse/computercraft">
                    ComputerCraft</a>!  Thanks, yut23!
