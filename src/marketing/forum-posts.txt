Title:

MAJOR UPDATE! Crafting Guide—Ultimate step-by-step guide to make anything

Body:

Have you ever wanted to figure out how much of what materials you need to craft something? Ever notice that certain
recipes are pretty easy... until you account for all the machines you need? Ever wonder how much stuff you'll need to
make a [Quarry](http://crafting-guide.com/item/quarry) or an entire
[QuantumSuit](http://crafting-guide.com/quantumsuit_bodyarmor)?

Crafting Guide will help. Choose what you want to make and how many of each, and it will automatically figure out:

* How many of what resources do you need?
* What tools / machines do you need?
* How many of what resource do you need for the tools?
* What items do you need to craft in what order?

I've just launched a brand-new version with support for vanilla, Buildcraft, and IndustrialCraft2 (classic) recipes.
It's all open-source, so anyone can help expand it to cover missing recipes, other mods, or add new features. Check out
the [GitHub project](https://github.com/andrewminer/crafting-guide) if you'd like to get involved!

If you've seen it before, go look again. There's a whole new site now, which supports a lot more than the old one did:

* All items have matching icons
* All recipes show the proper layout on the crafting grid
* You now get step-by-step instructions
* You can now make many different items at once (e.g., a whole NanoSuit)

A few more updates to report!  First, now your preferences for which mods are active and whether tools are included
will be remembered between visits. Second, I've finished adding support for Thermal Expansion 4.  The crafting algorithm
doesn't yet taken into account the ore-doubling/tripling machinery, but all the recipes for the entire mod are present
and functional.  I'll work on using the machines in a future update.  Next up: IC2 Experimental!

########################################################################################################################

I've just finished adding support for the latest version of Industrial Craft (2.2.663 on the experimental branch).  I've
also updated the site to let you select the version you're using.

########################################################################################################################

I just pushed up a big new feature!  Now, each Mod has a dedicated page of its own which lists all the items available
in that mod.  Clicking on an item will take you to the crafting guide for that item. It's super fast to switch back and
forth to explore the items in any given mod.  This is the first of many steps for the new mod pages, so keep an eye out
for more to come!

I've been working on a project to make it easier to deal with complex recipes, and I recently finished adding all the
core Minecraft recipes. The gist of the site is that you tell it what item(s) you want to make, and it will figure out
all the raw ingredients you need along with step-by-step instructions for any number of whatever items you like. For
example, [http://crafting-guide.com/crafting/16.potion_of_fire_resistance_8_00:16.potion_of_healing_ii here's how you
make] 16 potions of healing II and fire resistance (with extended duration).

The maintainers of many of the mods I've added (e.g., BuildCraft / Applied Energistics) have found it useful to include
links to Crafting Guide in their official documentation, and I was hoping you would think it a good idea to add links
from this wiki to CraftingGuide as well.  I'd be happy to do the work of adding the links myself, but I'd like to make
sure there are no objections first!

Thanks!

Crafting Guide—the ultimate step-by-step guide for Minecraft—Now with item detail pages!

I just pushed up another big update!  This one adds detail pages for each item from each mod.  These detail pages show:

* the item's basic information (name, icon, ...)
* a link to the item's full crafting plan
* the list of all recipes for that item
* the list of all items it can be used to make
* the list of all similar items

All of this gives you an extensive reference of related items and recipes.  Check it out by seeing what you can do with
a [Diamond](http://crafting-guide.com/item/diamond)!

I just released another exciting update for Crafting Guide!  This update adds a lot of small tweaks and adjustments to
the site's animations and some performance enhancements, but the big news is an enhanced crafting algorithm and
Railcraft support!

The new crafting algorithm, instead of using the first available recipe for any given item, will now choose the recipe
which is most effecient at producing that item. In other words, if you have a Macerator, it will be smart enough to use
it. It is also smart about using machines like the Block Cutting Machine to make plates.  And, as an extra bonus, it's
about twice as fast as the old algorithm.

With Railcraft support not only comes the huge richness of that mod, but the first multi-block structures in Crafting
Guide.  For example, check out how to make a [url=http://crafting-guide.com/crafting/blast_furnace]Blast Furnace[/url]!
